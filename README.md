java-facilities
===============

Combining different facility classes for Java

1. the classes are so small, that they are intended to be copied and pasted into existing projects 
2. they do not use any 3rd-party libraries besides guava, slf4j and the ones they provide API improvements or other conveniences for

All the code in the repo is licensed with MIT license, thus it is allowed to be copied and pasted, modified and intended for both commercial and private use free of charge.
